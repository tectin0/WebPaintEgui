# Web Paint Egui

Personal project to learn Rust in the browser. Exploring [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui), [wasm_bdingen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/) and how synchronization between a web client and server can be achieved with [TcpListener](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.TcpListener.html) and [Reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/).

## Disclaimer

This project is a work in progress and is not intended to be used for anything other than learning purposes.

Nothing here specifically adhers to any best practices, and anything that works is likely to be left as is.
